🐧 Penguin Species Clustering using K-Means
🧩 Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to apply K-Means Clustering on the Penguins dataset to group penguins based on their physical characteristics such as:

Culmen length (mm)

Culmen depth (mm)

Flipper length (mm)

Body mass (g)

Sex

The goal is to discover natural groupings (clusters) among the penguins using unsupervised machine learning, since we do not have predefined species labels.

🎯 Objective

To:

Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction

Use K-Means Clustering to group similar penguins

Evaluate the quality of clustering using various metrics

⚙️ Steps Involved
🧹 Step 1: Data Loading and Understanding

Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Used .head() to view the first few rows and understand the data.

The dataset includes continuous numerical features and one categorical feature (sex).

🧽 Step 2: Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using .dropna() to remove incomplete rows.

Detected outliers visually using a boxplot().

Removed extreme or unrealistic data points to improve model reliability.

🔠 Step 3: Feature Encoding (Creating Dummy Variables)

Converted the categorical column sex into numeric values using pd.get_dummies().

This step allows the algorithm to process categorical data numerically.

⚖️ Step 4: Feature Scaling

Used StandardScaler to standardize the data (mean = 0, variance = 1).

Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally, preventing bias toward larger numerical values.

🧮 Step 5: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features while preserving most of the variance.

Found that 2 principal components were sufficient to represent the data effectively.

This also helped visualize the clusters in a 2D plot.

🔍 Step 6: Finding Optimal Number of Clusters

Used the Elbow Method to determine the ideal value of k (number of clusters).

Plotted the number of clusters vs. inertia (within-cluster sum of squares).

The “elbow point” was observed at k = 4, which was chosen as the optimal number of clusters.

🔢 Step 7: Applying K-Means Clustering

Applied K-Means algorithm with n_clusters = 4.

Each penguin was assigned to a cluster based on feature similarity.

Plotted the results using a scatter plot of PCA components colored by cluster labels.

📈 Step 8: Model Evaluation

Evaluated clustering performance using three popular metrics:

Metric	Description	Your Score
Silhouette Score	Measures how similar each point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters (closer to 1 = better).	0.739
Davies–Bouldin Score	Measures average similarity between clusters (lower = better).	0.350
Calinski–Harabasz Score	Measures the ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster dispersion (higher = better).	1364.795

✅ The obtained scores show that the clusters are well-defined and separated — indicating strong clustering performance.

🧠 Theoretical Explanation of K-Means Clustering
🔹 What is K-Means?

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to divide a dataset into K clusters based on feature similarity.
It tries to minimize the distance between points within the same cluster and maximize the distance between points in different clusters.

⚙️ How It Works

Select K: Choose the number of clusters.

Initialize Centroids: Randomly select K points as initial cluster centers.

Assign Points: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.

Update Centroids: Compute new centroids as the mean of all points in each cluster.

Repeat: Continue until centroids stop changing significantly (convergence).

🧭 Mathematical Objective

K-Means minimizes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS):

📊 Advantages

✅ Simple and fast to implement
✅ Works efficiently on large datasets
✅ Easy to interpret and visualize (especially with PCA)

⚠️ Limitations

❌ Requires choosing the number of clusters (K) in advance
❌ Sensitive to outliers and scale of data
❌ Works best for spherical-shaped clusters

🧾 Conclusion

The project successfully implemented K-Means clustering on the Penguins dataset.

After cleaning, encoding, scaling, and applying PCA, K-Means effectively grouped similar penguins.

Evaluation metrics confirmed high-quality clustering results.

The project demonstrates the complete unsupervised learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to evaluation and visualization.
